----------------------------
INPUT FILES ("*.ori")
----------------------------
"ori" stands for Open River Input


0. WORKING DIRECTORY
file name   : "path_conf"
generated by: interface
content     : workspace path


1. GENERAL DATA
file name   : "modeldata.ori"
generated by: interface
content     : all model options (e.g. initial/end time, fixed/moving bed, Courant number, etc.)


2. GEOMETRY
file name   : "sections.ori"
generated by: interface
structure   :
              ns[number_of_sections]
              np(i)[number_of_section_points]   name(i)[name_of_section]
              na ia(i,1) ha(i,1)[m] ia(i,2) ha(i,2)[m] ...
              ...
comments    : i=index_of_section, j=index_of_point_within_section
              na=number_of_dykes (?)
              ia=index_of_dyke(1_left,2_right), ha=height_of_dyke

file name   : "points.ori"
generated by: interface
structure   :
              x(i,j)[m]   y(i,j)[m]   z(i,j)[m]   ks(i,j)[m^(1/3)/s]
              ...
comments    : for 1D case, x(i,j) depends only on i


file name   : "inoutflows.ori"
generated by: interface
structure   :
              nc[number_of_confluences]
              ic[index_of_section]
              ...confluence_data...
              ...
              nd[number_of_derivations]
              id[index_of_section]
              ...derivation_data...
              ...
comments    : ic and id are indentified by the interface on the basis of the in/out positions


file name   : "???.ori"
generated by: interface
structure   :
              ???
comments    : {briglie,soglie,ecc.}


3. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
file name   : "discharge.ori"
generated by: interface
structure   :
              nt[number_of_times]
              t(k)[s]   Q(k)[m^3/s]
              ...
comments    : this is the discharge at the head of the channels; 
              k is the index of times at which the discharge is known

...similar files will be generated for inflows (and outflows?) and for temperature, solutes, etc.


4. INITIAL CONDITIONS
file name   : "initial.ori"
generated by: interface (directly?) or copied by previous model's results
structure   :
              H(i)[m]   Q(i)[m^3/s]   ...all used variables...
              ...
comments    : i=index_of_section, general checks (e.g. number of sections) are performed by interface

----------------------------
OUTPUT FILES ("*.oro")
----------------------------
"oro" stands for Open River Output


1. CONTROL FILE
file name   : "ctrl.oro"
generated by: kernel
structure   : free
comments    : reports all significant information about the simulation; should be readable by interface


2. LIST OF OUTPUT TIMES
file name   : "times.oro"
generated by: kernel
structure   : 
              ko[index_of_output]   t_out(ko)[s]
              ...
comments    : ko is the index of times t_out at which output data are written to file;
              this file will be read by the interface at fixed times (e.g. every 1 s) 
              to check if new results are available to be plotted


3. RESULTS AT TIME t (=> INITIAL CONDITIONS)
file name   : "res_{--ko}.oro"
generated by: kernel
structure   :
              H(i)[m]   Q(i)[m^3/s]   ...all used variables...
              ...
comments    : ko in file name is the same index used in file "times.oro"
